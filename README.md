# AWSBlog

Blog built entirely for use in Amazon S3 without any server side code.

## Motivation

Having recently completed an AWS course I decided that a blog on my use of AWS would be a nice further learning experience, and where better to put it than into S3! Unfortunately I couldn't find any server-less blogs that I liked and decided to put something together using just client side technologies.

## Installation

The following settings can be set in the js/AWSBlogSettings.js file:

* PostsOnPage: This sets the number of posts found on each page of the main posts listing.
